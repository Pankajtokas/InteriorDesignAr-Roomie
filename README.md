To develop a android application for trying different furniture in virtual way. The application will eliminate the human efforts by physically visiting the furniture store which is very time consuming activity.

    About Module
In today’s world information and communication technology supports the development of
human interaction with physical, computer and virtual environment such as science,
commercial, banking, education, etc.
Augmented reality is a field of computer research which deals combination of reality with
computer related data. In early days if we users wanted to buy a furniture objects without
visiting the shops it was possible but it was not possible to check how the object actually
looks in home structure. Now in our proposed system, it is possible for user to buy the
furniture objects sitting in the home without visiting the shops.

The application will eliminate the human efforts by physically
visiting the furniture store which is very time consuming activity.Augmented reality is a
technology that combines virtual reality with reality.This paper presents an application of
Augmented Reality (AR) for interior design. Due to huge advancements in computer vision
algorithms and cheap hardware, Augmented Reality is becoming mainstream. Furniture retail
is a significant aspect of USA economy with over $100 billion in sales. However, most of the
sales come from physical stores. Buying furniture from brick and mortar shops is
cumbersome and time consuming. AR is changing the furniture industry. Big players like
IKEA, Wayfair, and Target are using this technology to boost sales by creating engaging
Omni channel experience. In an AR environment virtual furniture could be placed and
manipulated in the physical world in real time which allows the user to have an interactive
experience. Users would be able to visualize exactly how a table would look like in their
kitchen. When people can place an actual couch on the living room or visualize how a
bookshelf would look in different color. The risk of product return and logistics is drastically
reduced. As online stores replace brick and mortar shops, AR will play a vital role in the
furniture sales. This paper provides new ways an individual/enterprise could utilize AR to
design interiors.

    About app
Augmented reality is a technology within which we can see the objects in physical world
virtually, thus providing a composite view. It gathers a wide variety of user experiences. We
are going to develop a system with augmented reality that lets user to try on virtual furniture
in user’s real home structure before buying. From this user will be able to choose furniture
objects a lot easier. It will not be necessary to go shopping and long searching for the large
user need, or use a measure tape to find out whether or not the furniture would fit in
customer’s room or not. The main purpose of this project is to develop an application for
various furniture items in furniture stores virtually without using the actual means that is
incredibly exhaustive and time consuming activity. By using this application it will be
convenient for the user to do online shopping of furniture items.
This will additionally help the user to try out the furniture items in their room and they will
be able to see how it will look after placing furniture in it. User can attempt multiple
combination of furniture objects virtually without physically moving the furniture items. Our
motivation here is to increase the time efficiency and additionally improve the accessibility of
furniture try on by making this layout in augmented reality.

We implemented our Interior design app using Marker-less AR, we initially started with Markerbased approach because of the lack of support for Marker-less augmented reality. Mixed Reality headsets like HoloLens could easily solve the problem because it uses spatial mapping using different sensors, however HoloLens is still in its infancy, not a lot people have access to it and it is very expensive. Recently, Google announced its ArCore platform that would allow developers to create Marker-less AR experiences so we built our app around android ecosystem primarily because of its availability, discoverability, reliability, and agility. The development environment included Unity Game Engine, C# Programming Language, Visual Studio IDE and we currently only support android devices.
